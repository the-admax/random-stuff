# random-stuff
Some random scripts and programs written by myself for various daily (and not really) purposes or for single use.
They reflect the way I used to learn python programming, and might be helpful for someone. If any bugs're spotted,
feel free to report it.

Most of scripts were written from scratch for some single task, or some for automation. They are not supposed to be 
full-fledged tools for some generic tasks. If you like any of them, freely copy, modify, and do whatever you like! :)
They are all MIT licensed.

## EagleCAD Recover Script
Very simple tool I wrote for single use, when accidently erased the full project directory with all work done.
It might come in use some time for anybody. Needs some tuning, no performance measurements taken.

## HTTP File Extract
Another yet simple script, that extracts files embedded inside stored-email files or raw HTTP responses.
